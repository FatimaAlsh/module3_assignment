        <h3>Chicken </h3> 
        <p>Chicken makes a fantastic substitute for red meats. A great source of protein, the meat has been linked to a variety of health benefits:

          Stronger Bones and Muscles
          
          The lean protein in chicken is an excellent source of amino acids. Our bodies use amino acids to build muscle tissue, something that is particularly important as we age. Studies have also shown that higher protein intake helps to maintain bone mineral density. Eating chicken can help to build stronger muscles and promote healthier bones, decreasing the risk of injuries and diseases such as osteoporosis.
          
          Weight Management and Heart Health
          
          Research suggests that 25-30 grams of protein per meal can help us feel more full. Protein rich meals can make us feel fuller despite us eating less, which helps to promote better weight management. Healthier weight leads to improvements in risk factors for heart problems such as high triglyceride levels and high blood pressure. A food rich in protein, chicken can help with weight management and reduce the risk of heart disease.
          
          Better Mood
          
          Chicken contains the amino acid tryptophan, which has been linked to higher levels of serotonin (the “feel good” hormone) in our brains. The tryptophan levels in chicken aren’t high enough to make you feel instantly euphoric, but studies show it could help to boost serotonin levels when paired with other factors.
          
          Nutrition
          Chicken is filled with high-quality proteins and doesn’t contain much fat — especially if you eat lean cuts. Beyond its rich protein content, chicken also contains:
          
           Vitamin B12
          Tryptophan
           Choline
           Zinc
           Iron
           Copper
          
          Nutrients per Serving
